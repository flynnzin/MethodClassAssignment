# Method Class Assignment

This project was created as part of a programming assignment to demonstrate the use of classes, methods, parameters, and named arguments in a C# console application.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this assignment is to:

- Create a class with a `void` method
- Pass two integers as parameters to the method
- Perform a math operation on the first integer
- Display the second integer to the console
- Instantiate the class in the `Main` method
- Call the method normally and using named parameters
- Use clear comments to explain the code

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET Console Application
- Visual Studio

## 📂 Project Structure

,
## ▶ How It Works

1. A class called `MathOperations` is created.
2. Inside this class, a `void` method called `ProcessNumbers` receives two integers.
3. The method performs a math operation on the first number.
4. The second number is displayed using `Console.WriteLine`.
5. In the `Main` method:
   - The class is instantiated
   - The method is called with regular parameters
   - The method is called again using named parameters

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**
2. Build the solution
3. Run the application using `Ctrl + F5`
